# AI Thought Leaders Sentiment Analysis Platform

This project scrapes, processes, and analyzes social media posts from leading AI researchers using Python. The pipeline covers data collection, cleaning, sentiment analysis, and interactive visuals.

## Structure
- `src/`: source code modules (scraper, analysis, visualization)
- `notebooks/`: step-by-step Jupyter notebooks
- `data/`: raw, processed, and results data
- `tests/`: unit tests
- `docs/`: documentation

## Quickstart
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the notebooks in order:  
   `notebooks/01_data_collection.ipynb` → `...`

## How it works
- Scrapes Nitter/Twitter posts (e.g., Ilya Sutskever, Karpathy)
- Cleans and preprocesses data
- Computes sentiment (TextBlob/VADER/BERT)
- Plots sentiment distributions and trends
